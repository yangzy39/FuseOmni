# Meta Info: End-side Speech Models in the LLM Era (2025+)

## Task Definition
**Topic**: On-Device Speech Models in the Large Model Era.
**Time Window**: Jan 2025 - Present (2026).
**Key Focus**:
1.  **Shift to SLMs**: Transition from specialized acoustic models to Speech-Language Models (1B-3B params).
2.  **Multimodality**: Native Audio-Text models on edge.
3.  **Efficiency**: Techniques enabling GenAI speech models on mobile (4-bit/2-bit quantization, speculative decoding).

## Search Keywords (Broad)
- "on-device speech language model"
- "mobile speech LLM"
- "edge speech recognition transformer 2025"
- "lightweight speech generative model"
- "end-to-end speech translation mobile"
- "streaming speech LLM edge"
- "quantized whisper on-device"
- "small language model speech capabilities"
- "neural audio codec mobile"

## Intelligent Selection Criteria
1.  **Must be 2025+**.
2.  **Must be related to 'Large Models' or 'Generative AI'**: Excluding traditional small-footprint CNN/RNN unless compared with LLM.
3.  **Must be 'On-Device' friendly**: Mentions latency, parameters < 3B, quantization, pruning, or mobile deployment.

## Classification Framework (Hypothesis)
- **Native Edge SLMs**: (e.g., Mini-Omni, Qwen-Audio-Edge variants)
- **Distilled GenAI Models**: (e.g., Distil-Whisper variants, TinyLlama-Speech)
- **Unified S2S Architectures**: (Speech-to-Speech without text cascade)
- **Hardware-Software Co-design**: (NPU acceleration for Audio-LLMs)
