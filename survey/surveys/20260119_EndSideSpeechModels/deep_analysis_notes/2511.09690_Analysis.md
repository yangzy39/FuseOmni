# Paper ID: Omnilingual ASR: Open-Source Multilingual Speech Recognition (arXiv:2511.09690)

## 1. 核心任务 (Task Definition)
- **现存问题**: Most of the world's 7000+ languages are ignored by current ASR. Scaling language coverage is usually manual and costly.
- **论文解决**: Introduced "Omnilingual ASR", supporting 1600+ languages.
- **意义**: The "ImageNet moment" for long-tail languages. Relevant to edge because it offers 300M parameter variants for low-power devices.

## 2. 方法论归类 (Methodology Class)
- **核心类**: Massive Multilingual / Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).
- **核心机制**:
    - **7B Pre-training**: Scaled SSL to learn robust universal speech representations.
    - **LLM-inspired Decoder**: Encoder-Decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization.
    - **Community Sourcing**: Integrated data from local partnerships.
- **创新点**: Proving that a single model can handle 1600+ languages with "zero-shot" capabilities for unseen dialects.

## 3. 贡献总结 (Contribution)
- **Scale**: Largest language coverage to date (1600+).
- **Edge Variant**: Released 300M model for low-power devices, enabling universal translation on phones.
- **Ethical**: Focus on "No language left behind".
