# Paper ID: Granite-speech: Open-source speech-aware LLMs (arXiv:2505.08699)

## 1. 核心任务 (Task Definition)
- **现存问题**: High-quality speech-LLMs are often proprietary (GPT-4o) or research-only. There is a lack of "Open Weights" enterprise-grade speech LLMs with permissive licenses.
- **论文解决**: Released "Granite-speech" (2B and 8B), modality-aligned versions of Granite-3.3-Instruct.
- **意义**: Provides a strong, open-source (Apache 2.0) baseline for companies to build private, on-premise, or edge speech applications.

## 2. 方法论归类 (Methodology Class)
- **核心类**: Modality Alignment / Open Foundation Model.
- **核心机制**:
    - **Architecture**: Conformer Encoder + Windowed Query-Transformer Adapter + LLM Backbone (Granite).
    - **Training**: Trained on open-source corpora with ASR and AST targets.
    - **Dual Mode**: Can operate in "Speech Mode" (activating adapter) or "Text Mode" (preserving original LLM capabilities).
- **创新点**: The "Dual Mode" design ensuring the speech alignment doesn't degrade the text reasoning capability.

## 3. 贡献总结 (Contribution)
- **Performance**: Outperforms competitors trained on proprietary data in English ASR.
- **Availability**: 2B model is small enough for high-end edge devices (e.g., laptops, NVIDIA Orin).
- **License**: Apache 2.0 allows commercial use.
