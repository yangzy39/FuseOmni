# Paper ID: On-device Streaming Discrete Speech Units (arXiv:2506.01845)

## 1. 核心任务 (Task Definition)
- **现存问题**: Self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) like HuBERT/WavLM are great but too heavy for on-device streaming. Existing Discrete Speech Unit (DSU) approaches require full-sequence processing (non-streaming).
- **论文解决**: Proposed an optimized DSU extraction pipeline for *streaming* on-device scenarios.
- **意义**: Enables the use of rich semantic speech units (DSUs) in real-time edge applications, facilitating better integration with LLMs which operate on discrete tokens.

## 2. 方法论归类 (Methodology Class)
- **核心类**: Representation Learning / Streaming Optimization.
- **核心机制**:
    - **Reduced Attention Window**: Limiting the receptive field of the S3M to allow streaming inference with bounded latency.
    - **Model Pruning**: Reducing S3M size while preserving clustering quality.
- **创新点**: Making "Discrete Speech Units" (the bridge between Audio and LLM) streamable and light.

## 3. 贡献总结 (Contribution)
- **Efficiency**: 50% reduction in FLOPs.
- **Trade-off**: Only 6.5% relative increase in CER compared to heavy non-streaming baselines.
- **Viability**: Proves DSUs are a viable input format for real-time edge speech LLMs.
